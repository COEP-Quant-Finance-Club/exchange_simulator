# Exchange Simulator
# Overview
This project is a simulated financial exchange system that processes buy and sell orders and matches them based on defined rules.
The goal is to understand how real-world exchanges handle order flow, order books, and trade matching in a simplified environment.
# Components
- Order Flow: Validates and queues incoming orders
- Order Book: Stores buy and sell orders
- Matching Engine: Matches orders using price-time priority
- Simulation & Testing: Verifies correctness through test cases
# System Flow
1. User submits an order
2. Order is validated
3. Order is added to the order book
4. Matching engine attempts to match orders
5. Trades are generated
# Tech Stack
- Python
- GitHub
- Pytest (for testing)
# Status
Repository setup and documentation in progress.
